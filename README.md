# Blockze: A Unified Development Environment for Web3
Blockze provides a unified development environment for Web3 developers, revolutionizing the way Ethereum projects are explored, collaborated on, built, and deployed.


## About the Project
Blockze aims to simplify the development process of Ethereum projects by offering a visual online IDE environment. This makes writing, testing, and deploying smart contracts more intuitive and efficient. Our goal is to lower the barrier to entry for Web3 development while enhancing developer productivity, thereby accelerating innovation and growth within the Ethereum ecosystem.


## Features
- **Visual Programming Interface**: An intuitive drag-and-drop interface makes writing and interacting with smart contracts straightforward.
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Team members can collaborate in real-time, editing and testing smart contracts together.
- **One-click Deployment**: Simplified deployment process to deploy smart contracts to the Ethereum network with just one click.
- **multi-chain Support**: Supports multiple Ethereum-compatible chains, allowing developers to easily explore and leverage the advantages of different networks.
- **Rich Resources and Tools**: Integrates a wide range of development tools and libraries to help developers work more efficiently, along with providing extensive learning resources to promote knowledge sharing.


## Developed Using Sanic and PyScript
This project is developed using Sanic, a fast, asynchronous web framework for Python, enabling efficient backend services. Frontend interactions are powered by PyScript, allowing Python code to run directly in the browser. This combination offers a seamless development experience from backend to frontend, making Blockze a powerful tool for Web3 development.
